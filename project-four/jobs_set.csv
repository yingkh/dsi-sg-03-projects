The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities at MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Leaming 2.0 project: Deep learning application in AME (Semiconductor domain): Explore state-of-the-art deep learning technologies in Advance Manufacturing Engineering, especially in semiconductor industries. Including, but not limited to, yield analysis and prediction, predictive maintenance (PdM), advanced DoE analysis and prediction, etc. Medical Imaging Analysis: Combined with traditional medical imaging method, explore deep learning methods, such as segmentation, multiphase classification, etc., to improve the performance of disease detection, prediction, and treatment based on CT, X-Ray, etc. Multi-Target Deep Learning: Different branches or targets in a neutral network can enhance each other's performance. Compared with end-to-end deep neutral network, multi-target deep learn can handle multiple targets simultaneously and in this way, the speed, efficiency, and performance can be improved. Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy",Non-executive,Scientist (DL2.0 / SCD)  / I2R (A*STAR),https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/job/36862a245edeaadd48ae10e98b6d6481
